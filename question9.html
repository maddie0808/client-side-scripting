 <h1>What is HTTP and how is it different from HTTPS?</h1>
 <ul> 
      <li>HTTP, often seen when clicking links online,  stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.  This protocol outlines how web browsers interact and respond to commands by a user. Similarly, HTTPS also performs the same actions. However, the main difference lies in the security. Most sites nowadays use HTTPS because it provides an extra layer of encryption for the users. This means that any information shared with that site cannot be decoded or stoled by outside infiltrators. </li>
