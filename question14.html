 <h1>Explain the relationship between Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML), Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language (DHTML), and markdown (MD)</h1>
 <ul> 
      <li>SMGL defines the limits and standards of markup languages. HTML is an application under SMGL. XML is a subset of SGML, similar to HTML, however can define its own standards and applications. XHTML is an extension of HTML that is based on XML and can partner with XML applications. DHTML was created to be more interactive than HTML, allowing websites to be more dynamic. Markdown is a simpler format, creating sites that are easier for people to create and read.
