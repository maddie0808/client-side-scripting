 <h1>How is “the web” related to the internet?</h1>
 <ul> 
      <li>The world wide web refers to the pages and sites that are viewed on a device when accessing the internet. For example, applications such as Google that use “www” in links are a part of the web. On the other hand, the internet is the connection of networks that facilitates the web, allowing devices to communicate and exchange data on a worldwide scale.</li>
