 <h1>Describe the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) model of networking, in general terms, outlining how this protocol provides the data transfer mechanism required to establish client/server relationships:</h1>
 <ul> 
      <li>The internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) is a framework for organising protocols used for internet communication. This is directly related to client/server relationships because it facilitates the communication and data exchange necessary to allow clients and servers to communicate. This would most likely be found in the transport layer of the TCP/IP, setting guidelines for the communication necessary in client/server relationships.
