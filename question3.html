 <h1>Describe how servers, routers, switches, work stations, and other hardware components are part of the internet:</h1>
 <ul> 
      <li>Workstations are a type of computer that is designed to handle more powerful and specialised tasks. Multiple workstations can be connected to a switch, allowing the devices to share information seamlessly. Servers are also connected to the switch. The switches are then connected to a single router to form a larger network. The router is then connected to a modem, which converts the digital data from the router into a data type that can be transmitted across analog devices such as telephones, radios, or televisions. The modem also connects devices to the internet.
