 <h1>Describe and illustrate the development of the Web in general terms using the Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 generational paradigms</h1>
 <ul> 
      <li>The web (starting with 1.0) was created in 1989 and consisted of information available to users. It was a one way street of information that users consume. Web 2.0 allowed for users to interact with others through the web, creating the beginning of social media and content creation online. It allowed for content to be shared, changing the web from a company based system to one that was focused on the community and its users. Web 2.0 facilitated the first online chat forums, blogs, and wikis that created a shared community online. Web 3.0 is the newest version of the web, focussing on the individual user. This allows for customisable user experiences online. For example, targeted ads, AI automation and algorithms, tailored content, etc. li>
